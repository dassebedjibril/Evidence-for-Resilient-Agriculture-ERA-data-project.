### ERA is a one-of-a-kind dataset and analytical engine.

The dataset has been derived from more than 2,000 scientific papers reporting how the use of new agricultural technologies affect productivity,
resilience and greenhouse gas emissions. This core dataset including more than 100,000 observations is linked to more than 50
publicly available environmental datasets. I worked with these data and designed ways to improve the dataset, connected to
additional datasets, conducted new machine learning analyses to predict outcomes and answered stakeholder questions.
